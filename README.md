==========
    
About
---------
A simple web page that randomly selects from a list of options. There is a graphical element that flits through the elements and then calls the actual implementation which shuffles the list and then selects a random index to determine the selection.

The page uses HTML 5 Local Storage to persist the lists so that already selected elements are remembered between page loads.

An example can be found [here]([webiste]).
